BACKGROUND.

The Amazon Kindle is an e-book reader. 
The primary method for getting content on it is via 'whispernet'.
This service is not available outside of the US.

Its possible to manually add content (txt and mobipocket 'prc') directly
via the USB port - just like a USB memory stick.

THE IDEA.

Version 1.

[in Java]

Build a simple RSS reader (use existing libraries) to auto-download blog (etc)
content to a indexed local repository. (use 'hibernate->mysql [etc])?

Strip bare HTML to basic text and format simply for the Kindle.

Build a simple 'sync' function to transfer to Kindle via USB.
(initially , this can just be a copy to the device).

Version 2.

Add functionality to allow more management to the local repository, improve sync function. 

Improve file format - so that 'prc' files can be generated - include images etc where appropriate - and tables of content etc.

Version 3.

...Shouldn't be necessary - since I'm sure Amazon will eventually release another Kindle which will work outside of the US :)
